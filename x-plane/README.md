# X-Plane Configurations

Here you'll find various tidbits of information I've collected as I experiemnt with [X-Plane](https://www.x-plane.com/)

## Installing X-Plane

- Purchase: My first mistake was to assume I had to buy X-Plane as traditional software. I found it on Amazon, and awaited a DVD install. Which I then had to confirm I even had one.  
  After being impatient, I found I could download directly from [X-Plane](https://www.x-plane.com/desktop/buy-it/). You could even downlad the demo for free.

- Install *warning*: To install X-Plane is basically just copy a bunch of files to a local user directory. Which defaults to your desktop. Just be careful about One Drive owning that directory, and filling up your One Drive folder, and taking an enormous amount of time to sync.

- Making a copy: You may want to keep this default install clean and fresh. Make a copy for all your add-ons, that will essentially overlay some files. Having a backup reference is really nice to troubleshoot add-on issues, which you will have.

## Dependency Management

One of the big challenges with X-Plane is the installation of extensions. While the simplicity of copying content to a folder is nice to understand, it adds a bunch of complexity. As of X-Plane 11, dependency management is a week point, where authors post their content, and while many understand the dependencies they require, trying to find them is even harder.

My goal here is to list the extensions I've found useful, and links to the dependencies I've found they require. As I write this, I also realize that I may not know of all the dependencies. If I happen to have a dependency previously installed, I won't get a warning, or error. So, this is my best attempt.

## Scenery

As I battled X-Plane performance, I learned it's a combination of good hardware, as well as good scenery. Once I was getting decent [fps][fps] (for X-Plane), I realized the low quality wasn't the rendering, rather the default scenery and [liveries] that come with the default X-Plane install. 

### Scenery Libraries

As noted in dependencies, a many add-ons depend on other libraries. These are the most common I've found. Cumulatively, they've improved the overall experience. 

-  [OpenSceneryX](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/2226-opensceneryx/)  
A set of enhanced objects that will make the default experiences appear more real. It's also a dependency of many add-ons.  
  The download takes you to an [externally managed site](https://www.opensceneryx.com/) which provides an install, and decent instructions.

- [The Handy Objects Library](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/24261-the-handy-objects-library/)  
  Similar to Open Scenery, it contains a set of objects used by other add-ons.

- [MisterX Library](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/28167-misterx-library-and-static-aircraft-extension/)  
  A scenery library that adds static aircraft to the game (among other things).

### Scenery Add-Ons

- [Project Manhattan](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/56010-x-plane-11-project-manhattan/)  
  I had high hopes for this one. It does add some nice additions to the Chelsea area, along the waterfront. As a free add-on, it's great for those that know the city and want to get more of a local feel.

### Airport Add-Ons

- [KPHX Phoenix Sky Harbor International](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/26819-kphx-phoenix-sky-harbor-international/)
- [KRNO Reno-Tahoe International](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/55976-krno-reno-tahoe-international/)

## Aircraft

### Free Dual Engine Planes

#### Free Helicopters
- [Updated Sikorsky](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/50881-updated-sikorsky-s-76-for-xp-1130/)
- [Bell 206-19 - Helicopter](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/51369-bell-206-19-helicopter/)
- [Hughes 500D - Helicopter](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/52938-hughes-500d/)
### Paid Dual Engine Planes
- [Carenado - B58 Baron](https://www.aerosoft.com/us/flight-simulation/xplane-11/aircraft/2642/carenado-b58-baron-xp11?c=891)  
  As the Baron B58 is my first dual engine plane, I'm still using the default X-Plane Baron B58. If I continue to fly the Baron, I may purchase this one.

## Plugins

These are functional enhancements to X-Plane. They range from enhanced Air Traffic Control systems to simple checklists, which become crucial to learning, and flying various planes. 

- [XCHecklist](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/20785-xchecklist-linwinmac3264/)  
Sure, it's a SIM, and if you crash, who cares? If you want a real experience, a good check-list is pretty crucial.  
  My checklists are [here](./xchecklists/)

[fps]:      ../definitions.md#fps
[liveries]: ../definitions.md#liveries
