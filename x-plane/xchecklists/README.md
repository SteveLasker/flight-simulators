# X-Plane Checklists
Checklists in [XChecklist](https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/20785-xchecklist-linwinmac3264/) format

The checklists here are from various sources. Some I've had to create myself as I'm learning to fly.

They're all in XChecklist format, which I've found pretty productive.
I have disabled voice commands, as there's no way to skip through the co-pilot readout, and each command must be voiced completly.
