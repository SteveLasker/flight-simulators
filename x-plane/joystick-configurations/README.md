# All my X-Plane 11 Joystick Configurations

My current joystick configuration consisis of the following:

- [Yoke: Honeycomb Alpha Flight Yoke and Switch Panel I](http://www.mypilotstore.com/mypilotstore/sep/13520)
- [Joystick: Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog Joystick & Throttle Control](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00371R8P4/)
- [Pedals: Thrustmaster TPR Pedals](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DQY8LVC/)
- Throttle Body  
  Not yet purchased, so many of the Warthog Thottle configurations double up for only two throttle levers.

When flying planes, that use a yoke, I use the Alpha Flight Yoke setup, and disable the Warthog Joystick. It just takes up too much real estate, and it's not very realistic.

For helicopters, jets (not flying yet), and giders, I use the joystick and disable the yoke.

## Specific Configurations

- **Beachcraft Baron B58**  
  My latest configurations, that utilizes dual engines, and keyboard mappings for views.
- **Cessna Skyhawk**  
  The first configuration I made, which now needs some merging from the Baron
- **Glider**  
  Uses the Warthog Joystick. Needs some updating
- **Helo Sikorsky**  
  Uses the Warthog Joystick. Also needs updating as I only messed with this a bit

## File Placement

Since all the files go in the `X-Plane 11\Output\preferences\control profiles\` folder, I've simply placed the list here.

As a ***TODO:*** I plan to extract the specific Joystick configurations that are most common, that I use across all planes. This way, I can start with that base, then add the specific flight changes. Like dual engine, or joystick vs. yoke.
