Content related to learning and working with various flight simulators.

Over the 2019 Holidays, I treated myself to a flight sim setup. I was looking to take a break from the daily multi-tasking of hundred things at work, home, kids and hobbies, and learn a new skill, with a methodical focus. 

Learning anything new is a journey. Here's the paths I've taken, that hopefully can help others as it was, as most things, a mixed scattering of information across the internet and various retailers.

## My Goal

Immerse myself into a semi-realistic environment. While some have created fully immersive experiences, [with actual airframes](https://twitter.com/fouldsy/status/1206431200811708417?s=20), I was focused on a smaller space, work/play balance. 

**Diversity of aircraft**: While building out an actual plane or helicopter is quite intriguing, I wanted to have a variety of choices from small Cessnas, helicopters to gliders then jets.


## My Computer Setup

I tried my sons gaming computer, but found it was not as capable as I was hoping. So, after a bunch of research on CPUs, mother boards, cases, and most importantly video cards, I decided it was easier to just throw money at the problem than attempt to dwindle into option. Open the credit-card flood gates. 

**The result:** For someone that hasn't bought a computer in 10 years, as I just use my work laptop, I decided to build, vs. buy. Thankfully I've got some great computer friends to help with the purchase choices and configurations. I've never had a computer that starts up as quick, is as snappy and fun to use. Thus, this content has been fun to assemble as well. 

My current setup consists of the following:

  This was really handy to enable/disable the various joysticks, and cleanup the cable mess. With a standup desk, it's also handy to not have to worry about all the cables reaching.

## Specific Flight Simulators

- [X-Plane](./x-plane/README.md)
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 - combing soon, *I hope*

## How Do I
  A list of things I need to research and update here. 
  - Which runway to use, and how to determine the wind angle?
  - What is the startup and flight routine for each plane? Jumping in a plane that's already running isn't as much fun.
  - Configure all the buttons on each joystick, yoke and foot pedal controls? This turned out to be much more tedious than I had expected. See [X-Plane Joystick Configurations](./x-plane/joystick-configurations/).
  - Get the most sim performance out of my hardware?
