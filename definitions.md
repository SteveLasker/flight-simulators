# Terms & Definitions

A list of terms I've learned along the way

## FPS

The number of frames per second refreshed to your screen. Standard TV is 30 FPS, with two fields per frame. This equates to essentially 60 FPS, which is what is considered high quality. The human eye can only see about 30, but the difference between 30 and 60 is a matter of the speed of the imagery and how fast they eye may see the smooth transistions as content flies across the screen. 

X-Plane performs pretty well at 20-25 FPS, and is about the max you'd see in densely populated areas, or with densely populated imagery. While I've seen 50 FPS, it's typically in the mountains, or at night where the number of objects that need to be created and painted are minimum. 

There's a lot of debate within the X-Plane community on FPS. IMHO, it's really a justification for a product that so many are passionate about. 

## Liveries

[As defined](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/livery): *"liveries are a distinctive uniform"*. The defintion continues to refer to people and badges at a time of war. In the flight simulation world, the refer to the outside uniform of an aircraft, that has [quite a market](https://store.x-plane.org/Liveries_c_314.html), both for pay and free.
